Configuration files for ESLint

TODO:
- fill in empty options after discussion
- update node version!!! here and in maf repo!
- update maf package.json version to proper version
- test maf.js with linter as well, before release to internal
- ESLint shared config and use .js file instead of .json - also requires renameing the repo!!!
- update package.json author part
- add editor instructions: sublime, webstorm, vsc
- update sdk docs - readme + website, to refer to these new rules
- create git.io address -> repo + package.json
- own rules; typeOf, (un)subscribe - but only in maf repo -> so that extends this default config
- incorporate in dashboard/release server
